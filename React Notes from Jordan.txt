  Jordan's starter kit  
    on his github -> the extensions to react that he typically needs.
      it includes node.js
        but it's "not server-side rendered" the way next.js assumes you will do.
          send them a bundle of JS and near empty html. -> like his website. The browser builds the html based on JS logic. React builds it.
    This seems like it would make CSS harder.
      Jordan says there are variants of CSS to use in this case -> nobody writes vanilla CSS
        Read about: 1) JSS (react-JSS) 2) styled-components (easier to get started with, but not as nice) 3) emotion 4) SASS/LESS (slightly behind the times)
